Three files: 

Pure SQL from Prasang's scripts (see below):
astro_sql_examples.sql

Pure datalog:
astro_datalog_examples.dlog 

Interleaved SQL and datalog (probably the most useful):
astro_examples_interleaved.txt  

This was a literal translation of the SQL.  
There are more succinct ways to express this stuff. 

In particular, we don't need a table/view for each timestep.
We want to union everything together, then express this recursively.


Prasang's notes:
> details in paper: Loebman et al., IASDS 09
> SQL: Prasang says  "The datasets are in taipei under the database nbody. The
> queries are generated by a python script called getTopProgenitor.py in the
> folder data-economics/data-share/code/QueryGenerator/workingScripts.
> Executing the script generates about 10 sql scripts in the folder called
> nbody_sql. Of these, setup.sql is the script that computes the progenitors
> and nonprogenitors."
> Alternate data source? in
